# Projectname: uwicore@umh_80211_MAC

# Filename: ul_buffer.py

# This script emulates the Upper Layer (above MAC) functionality developed by the Uwicore Laboratory 
# at the University Miguel Hernandez of Elche. It consists of a pair of packet buffers, the first one 
# stores the packets received from the MAC and the second one stores the packets that are going
# to be sent to the wireless medium. More detailed information can be found at 
# www.uwicore.umh.es/mhop-testbeds.html or at the publication:
